Hi, I am a software developer, I live and work in Vinnytsia, Ukraine. I've been building software professionally since 2014. I write Swift, C, C++, and Objective-C. I have experience in designing and developing of cross- platform desktop applications, command line tools, and mobile applications. Throughout my career, I use technologies such as Qt, OpenGL, and iOS SDK. Since 2018 I work mainly as an iOS/macOS developer.
